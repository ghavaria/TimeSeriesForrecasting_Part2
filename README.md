# TimeSeriesForrecasting_Part2

In an autoregressive model, the regression technique is used to formulate a time series problem. In order to implement autoregressive models, we forecast future observations using a linear combination of past observations of the same variable, i.e., to predict the 
^
y
t
, future forecast of a variable, we need one or more past observations of 
y
t
 that is
